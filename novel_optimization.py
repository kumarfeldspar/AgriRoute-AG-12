novel_optimization.py
---------------------
A simplified demonstration of a "novel" approach using MILP.

We define decision variables for:
  x_{f,h,v} = 1 if farm f is served by vehicle v and goes to hub h
  y_{h,c,v} = 1 if hub h is served by vehicle v going to center c
We also incorporate capacity constraints for hubs and vehicles, plus disruptions, etc.
