--------------

Implements an "improved" Genetic Algorithm for the multi-stage farm->hub->center
distribution problem, using:
  - Roulette wheel selection
  - Adaptive crossover and mutation probabilities (based on cost)
  - A shipment-based representation (each gene = (farm_id, hub_id, center_id, vehicle_id))

Outputs:
  1) ga_solution.json   (solution details)
  2) paths.json         (list of routes per vehicle)

# ------------------------- Usage Example -------------------------
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Suppose you already have your farms, hubs, centers, vehicles, and dist_dict loaded
    # from somewhere (JSON, database, etc.). You'd do something like:
    #
    # farms = [...]
    # hubs = [...]
    # centers = [...]
    # vehicles = [...]
    # dist_dict = {("farm", f_id, "hub", h_id): [{...}, {...}], ...} etc.
    #
    # Then just call:
    #
    # sol = run_genetic_algorithm(
    #     farms, hubs, centers, vehicles, dist_dict,
    #     pop_size=80, max_generations=100,
    #     output_file="ga_solution.json", paths_file="paths.json"
    # )
    #
    # print("Best GA solution cost:", sol["best_cost"])
    pass
